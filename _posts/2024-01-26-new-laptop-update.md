My _new to me_ Thinkpad T480 is doing great. The better processor and the upgraded Nvidia MX150 GPU are both getting a workout with several of the new LLM models. I maxed out the RAM, Wifi, Hard Drive, and swapped around adding all the best components/features to one laptop consolidated from several different junkers I purchased. Those components include IR Camera, WWAN, backlit keyboard, good batteries, and a nice case.

WSLv2 with Ubuntu is taking advantage of the newer CPU and RAM. The NVMe is making the disk access fly.

Upgrades done:

- [X] Add 64Gb RAM
- [X] Convert 2.5" SSD bay to NVME 2280 caddy
- [X] 4Tb NVME hard drive
- [X] Add a backlit keyboard
- [X] Add Wifi 6e upgrade
- [X] Replace Internal battery
- [X] Replace External battery with extended duration 72Wh
- [X] IR Camera for biometrics
- [X] Verify dual 4K monitor via USB-C and Thunderbolt

The 64Gb RAM is really nice to have for the machine learning work I tried out. The 2Gb VRAM is anemic on the GPU but enough to try a few things out and offload to regular RAM taking a performance hit.

Adding Wifi 6e is an absolute necessity and worth the $20 without a doubt.

WWAN cellular as an option is something I didn't anticipate wanting or needing but I've found it as a nice feature and would look to keeping it around in future laptops. Using my cellphone Wifi sharing is nice enough but just having my laptop fully independant is worth something.

NVMe hard drive is nice for the performance improvement from SSD and not priced out of range. Another no brainer.

Backlit keyboard is not something I use extensively but nice to have around every blue moon. The touchscreen monitor fits in this category of nice to have but would not buy it.

Upgrade options:

- [ ] LCD Rear cover magnesium (lighter case)
- [ ] Replace internal LCD screen with lower power version
- [ ] Replace internal LCD screen with 4k version
- [ ] ~~Add a M.2 2242 SSD hard disk module~~
- [ ] ~~Glass Trackpad replacement (from X1)~~
- [ ] ~~Add Coral TPU M.2 Edge Accelerator B+M Key in WWAN~~

I bought the Glass X1 Trackpad replacement on Aliexpress but found the driver support was a pain to deal with when installed and it just wasn't the much of a difference for my usage. I ended up removing it and going back to the base trackpad without being bothered.

Changing out the Wifi or WWAN for a TPU or M2 SSD means missing out of those network features which I would rather have the cellular option and Wifi 6E than those the extra hard drive or TPU.

## Summary

I would do this again in a heartbeat. This _new to me_ laptop is great and letting me do work I could not do on my older one. The addition of the twin 4K monitors, updated GPU and expanded memory all make for a better experience. Windows 11 support gives me another couple years. I have future options like adding an eGPU via Thunderbolt 3 that were not even options. A Hackintosh option for the T480 exist where the X1 trackpad may become useful with the second laptop I have for parts.

So this was worth the effort and I would do it again.
