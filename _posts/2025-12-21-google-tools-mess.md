Lions and Tigers and Adsense, oh my...

I've been working on getting Google Adsense back online with my website for about a year to no avail. Early on, it complained that I had too much duplication content that appeared to be plagerised. But it was my consolidated content from the past several decades and was my postings. Well, fast forward to 2025 and I have over half my content generated in the last two years and not two decades.

I've plugged in Google Analytics to track my traffic.
I plugged in GOogel Search Console but I'll take my licking there... a bad `sitemap.xml` and other things kept that from working well. Since fixed those and waiting for it to play nice.
Google Custom Search is a weird beast but I'm trying it out. I've got an article on it at /adding-google-custom-search 2025-12-07 to release.
