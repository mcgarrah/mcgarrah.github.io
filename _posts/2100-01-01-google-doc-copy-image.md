Google Docs uses a URL based clipboard method to copy/cut and paste that works great between other Google Docs. But it fails when I try to take images from Google Docs to my Jekyll Posts when I need an image file. This is a small things but took some digging to figure it out.

In the Google Document,
double-click the image
    press shift + right-click the image
        "open in new tab" then save image
        or
        "save image as..."

The "copy image" and other options don't copy to the mac or windows clipboard.
