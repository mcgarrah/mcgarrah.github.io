I was reading a bit more on DLNA servers and found that someone had gotten [miniDLNA](http://minidlna.sourceforge.net/) working under the Debian port for the BlackArmor NAS.  NickolasZev looks like he is enjoying his Debian install on his BA110. He is documenting his Debian [initial install](http://nickolaszev.blogspot.com/2012/01/install-debian-lenny-in-nas-110.html), adding [miniDLNA](http://nickolaszev.blogspot.com/2012/01/install-mediatomb-or-minidlna-prefer.html), a [webserver](http://nickolaszev.blogspot.com/2012/01/nas-110-part-3-install-lighttpdphpmysql.html), [bittorrent](http://nickolaszev.blogspot.com/2012/01/nas-110-part-4-bittorent-client-to-nas.html) and [download manager](http://nickolaszev.blogspot.com/2012/01/nas-110-part5-download-manager.html). I'm not interested in putting Debian on mine and want to stay as close to the vanilla firmware as possible but it is nice to see that someone has it working on the hardware.
