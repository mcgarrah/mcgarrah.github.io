Summary

Jekyll Theme from https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast is really nice as a starting point for Jekyll on Github Pages.
It was last updated on March 13 of 2021.

I have a `clean` branch that I'm getting down to just the basic changes I want to release back upstream to Niklas and his original template.

I have an upstream branch that I synced with `master` from https://github.com/niklasbuschmann/contrast so I can check the difference between my `main` branch changes as well.

```console
âžœ  mcgarrah.github.io git:(main) git diff clean upstream
```

This is an interesting problem to solve for me since I have multiple changes in play.
