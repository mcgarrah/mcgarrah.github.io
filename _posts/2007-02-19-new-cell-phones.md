I bought new cell phones (Motorola Razor v3) for the whole family and I've just gotten them connected to my laptop. I'm trying to get my calendar and contact list on Gmail to download to it. The MPT (Motorola Phone Tools) lets you tie Outlook or Lotus Notes to your phone. The 5th gen video ipod has a tool to convert Gmail Calendar into your iPod. That might be an interesting place to start. It would be nice to tie the calendar together for the whole family on our phones.

The phone itself is actually quite a powerful little toy. The mobile java is an interesting environment.
