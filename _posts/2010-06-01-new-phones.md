Well last I posted, we just got the *new* Motorola Razr's in 2007. Dumped those last month and have the Motorola Droid's for all three of us. Nifty little things with lots of apps and things.

They are teaching a course at NCState on Java programming on Android which sounds interesting. I got a couple of books on programming for them but no time to mess with it yet.

Post later.
