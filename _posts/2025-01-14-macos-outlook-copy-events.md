The direct Copy/Paste of an event is no longer offered in Outlook on the Mac. This may also impact Windows users but I donâ€™t have access to test it out.

This functionality was intentionally removed by Microsoft for reasons mentioned in their post.

There is another method that was not obvious that does the same thing.

## How to

I am copying the intent from both the *sixcolors* and Stackoverflow posts for the MacOS Sonoma. So read those posts below for more details.

``` shell
cd /etc/pam.d
sed "s/^#auth/auth/" /etc/pam.d/sudo_local.template | sudo tee /etc/pam.d/sudo_local
```

How to test and drop the cached permissions. The `-k` resets the `sudo` permissions so you are prompted for your authorization again.

```console
sudo ls
sudo -k
sudo ls
```

You should see the Touch ID then you are set.

If you see this dialog with only a Password option then check below for more things you can do.

### DisplayLink

If you are using **DisplayLink** then you will need to enable permissions or you will not see the Touch ID option.

``` shell
defaults write com.apple.security.authorization ignoreArd -bool TRUE
```

### tmux

If you are using `tmux` then you need to add [pam_reattach](https://github.com/fabianishere/pam_reattach) for sessions to automatically work. The [README.md](https://github.com/fabianishere/pam_reattach/blob/master/README.md) is excellent. Using `brew` and the Apple M1 or M2 requires some additional steps they mention.

``` shell
brew install pam-reattach
```

### iTerm2

[Touch ID on Mac in iTerm](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/259093/can-touch-id-on-mac-authenticate-sudo-in-terminal/355880#355880) has some configuration settings that you will need to change.
**iTerm2 -> Preferences -> Advanced -> (Goto the Session heading) -> Allow sessions** and change from "Yes" to "No".
