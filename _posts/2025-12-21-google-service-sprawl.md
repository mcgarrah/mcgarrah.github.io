Lions and Tigers and Adsense, oh my... All the Google Services I think I need. And all the overhead for them.

Running a technical blog has turned into a maze of Google services, each with its own setup complexity, approval processes, and interconnected dependencies. What started as a simple Jekyll website has become an exercise in Google service integration frustration.

## The Google AdSense Nightmare

I've been trying to get Google AdSense back online with my website for over a year with no success. I had it working on WordPress prior to 2016, but after migrating to Jekyll and consolidating decades of content, Google flagged my site for "duplicate content that appeared to be plagiarized."

The irony? It was **my own content** from my previous blogs and websites, consolidated into one place. Fast forward to 2025, and I have over half my content generated in the last two years, yet AdSense still rejects my applications with vague, unhelpful feedback.

## The Service Integration Treadmill

Each Google service requires its own setup dance, and they're all interconnected in ways that aren't immediately obvious:

**Google Analytics**: Set up in August 2024 during a website modernization push. Relatively straightforward, but required privacy policy updates and cookie consent considerations.

**Google Search Console**: This one bit me hard. Spent months with a broken sitemap because I had `localhost:4000` URLs instead of my actual domain. The error messages were cryptic, and it took forever to realize the URL configuration issue.

**Google Custom Search**: A weird beast that sort of works but feels like a compromise. Better than no search, but the styling integration is a nightmare and it doesn't always index new content promptly.

**Google AdSense**: The white whale. Still rejected after multiple attempts, vague feedback, and jumping through hoops like adding privacy policies, fixing "content quality" issues, and ensuring GDPR compliance.

## The Google Service Complexity Matrix

**Services I'm Actually Using:**

- **Google Analytics**: Works well once configured, but requires privacy policy updates and cookie consent banners for GDPR compliance
- **Google Search Console**: Useful when it works, but error messages are cryptic and debugging sitemap issues is painful
- **Google Custom Search**: Functional but feels like a hack - styling integration is terrible and indexing is inconsistent
- **Google AdSense**: The promised land I can't reach - endless rejections with vague feedback

**Services I Think I Should Be Using:**

- **Google Tag Manager**: Supposedly simplifies tag management, but adds another layer of complexity
- **Google PageSpeed Insights**: Helpful for performance, but recommendations often conflict with other Google service requirements
- **Google Optimize**: A/B testing sounds great, but requires Tag Manager integration (more complexity)
- **Google Trends**: Useful for content planning, but another dashboard to monitor

## The Real Problem

Each service exists in its own silo with its own:

- Dashboard and interface
- Approval process and requirements
- Integration complexity
- Privacy and compliance implications
- Performance impact on the website

What should be a simple "add analytics and search" becomes a multi-month project involving privacy policies, cookie banners, multiple dashboards, and endless troubleshooting of interconnected systems that don't always play nicely together.

## The Frustration Factor

The most maddening part? Google's own services don't integrate seamlessly with each other. You'd think Google Analytics and Google Search Console would share data more effectively, or that Google Custom Search would automatically index content that Google Search Console knows about.

Instead, each service feels like it was built by a different team with different assumptions about how websites work. The result is a fragmented experience that requires significant time investment to get working properly.

Maybe I'm overthinking this, but for a simple technical blog, the overhead of managing all these Google services sometimes feels like it outweighs the benefits. I just want a blog site to publish fun stuff I'm doing outside of work. On the upside, I'm keeping current on a lot of the issues that happen for small to medium sized businesses which keeps me current on technology that might get me a future job. Occasionally, this stuff also overlaps with my real job too.

Cheers from the Homelab.
