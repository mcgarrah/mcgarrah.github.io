My past write up for a [Backlog of Posts](/backlog-of-posts/) had all the things that I wanted to write about in mid-2024. It has been updated with links to the released posts that covered each as I finished up in 2024. I got a lot of them written but the backlog of drafts and things I wanted to write about also grew as I picked off drafts and added new posts.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

Here is a list of my unpublished draft posts that need time and polishing to release:

* Before June 2024
  * Learning Jekyll
  * Site to Site VPN for the Homelabs
  * Link Aggregated (LAG) and LACP NIC Bonding
  * PiKVM v3 and AIMOS 8-port KVM Setup (hacking the webui)
* After June 2024
  * Proxmox 8.x SDN with and without OpenWRT
  * Name Service Registrars (DNS) Reviews (after Google Domains shutdown)
  * Chocolatey Packaging (for easyWSL)
  * Oh My Zshell on WSL (to keep consistent with MacOS)
  * Contribute a set of features upstream as PRs back to the Jekyll Template I used
  * Discuss eMMC vs regular storage for Debian/Proxmox

I have learned a lot of lessons along the way building this website and my online resume. Jekyll on the Github Pages with Github Workflows come to mind immediately as things I want to write about to figure out what I have learned. Those are really powerful tool combinations for your tool box. Along the way, I had ideas I want to explore further and often drop a draft post that I keep my notes and thoughts at the time so I can revisit it as I have time later. I've collected a number of those in the backlog.

The [Dell Wyse 3040 Tailscale](/dell-wyse-3040-tailscale/) nodes in my network alleviated the immediate need I had for the site-2-site VPN using Wireguard. I'd like to have a redundant connection setup for my networks using my other [Wireguard hardware](https://www.gl-inet.com/products/gl-mt2500/) but those are also backlogged.

I did get the article out on the [HP ProCurve 2800 WebUI](/java-jnlp-webui/), but still have not upgrade my primary network to them or the Wifi 6e wireless units. The value to time invested is there but time is a limited resource. Those will end up being a weekend project that just happens when I catch my breath.

I still don't have my **media service** up and running. Those will generate a lot of posts once I get that rolling.

Many of these are just projects that are stalled with my limited time that I can invest. Some of just abandoned as I find something new that catches my interest. A few are blocking getting cool stuff that I want to do. I doubt this list will get shorter anytime soon but hopefully, I get more posts out as I finish up some of these.

Looking back at what I got done and what I have in the backlog is helpful to me personally.
