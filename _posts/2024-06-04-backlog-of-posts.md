I've got a backlog of posts I want to do on various topics. A couple of recent posts, I figured getting out something rough was better than not getting it out and just posted what felt like it needed another review or draft. I'll likely review those and update them as time permits.

Here is a dump of my unpublished posts that need polishing to release:

* Learning Jekyll
* Site to Site VPN for the Homelabs
* Link Aggregated (LAG) and LACP NIC Bonding
* HP ProCurve Switch Java WebUI (Java JNLP WebStart)
* Dell Wyse 3040 Initial Setup (tailscale endpoints)
* PiKVM v3 and AIMOS 8-port KVM Setup (hacking the webui)
* ProxMox 8 Lessons Learned in the Homelabs (pain points and solutions)

I've been working on the WireGuard VPN setup and an updated homelab network as time permits. Those are blocking other fun projects I want to do. Sadly, I have to sleep and work and cannot finish all these fun projects and posts.
