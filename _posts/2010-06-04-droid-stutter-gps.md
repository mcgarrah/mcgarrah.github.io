Ran into a goofy problem with my Motorola Droid after it just working great for the last few months.  The GPS just decided to stop connecting one day.  This is major bad news as the turn-by-turn navigation is a really nice feature I use a lot.

Of course I had not done anything before it stopped working ....  except add Google Latitude with cell tower location, uninstall the WeatherChannel application, and installed the Weatherbug application.

Dug into the forums and found something on Weatherbug and pulling the battery on restart.  Finally figured out it was probably the "Fix for GPS bug" option in Weatherbug.  Testing it and posted it back to the Google Help.
