1. Point to Point network



2. Switched network

Here are a pile of network switches that are both new and ancient that could support 10Gbps.

Price per SFP+ port is one metric.

Power consumption and acoustic (noise) are others to consider.

Maybe get Amazon affilitate links for pricing (small kick back to me) on MikroTik switches

- Mikrotik CRS310-1G-5S-4S+IN 10Gigabit Switch 1G port 5 x SFP ports 4 x SFP+ port
 - ~$200 USD
 - 5 SFP 1Gbps
 - 4 SFP+ 10Gbps
 - 1 1Gbps Ethernet

- MikroTik CRS309-1G-8S+IN Switch Gigabit Ethernet Port and 8x SFP 10 Gbps Ports
 - ~$270 USD
 - 1 1Gbps Ethernet
 - 8 SFP+ 10Gbps

- MikroTik CRS305-1G-4S+IN 5-port Network Switch 10Gbps Gigabit Dual System

 - 1 1Gbps Ethernet
 - 16 SFP+ 10Gbps

- HP Procurve 5406zl Switch
  - crazy price range on ebay $350 to $4000
  - Plugin modules for functionality range widely
  - Six module slots
  - 
- J9309A - HP ProCurve 4-port 10GbE SFP+ ZL Module 2C3 (module)

This only gets you part of the way to the price.
