A couple of useful scripts I've found or created to help manage my Proxmox 8.2 with Ceph Reef (18) cluster. Some are simplistic but useful. I also have some fun commands I've found along the way that I just keep as a cheat-sheet item.

```console
root@harlan:/mnt/pve/cephfs/bin# ls
ceph-down.sh  cssh                osd-optimize.md     rsync-drive-tvshows.sh
ceph-up.sh    dev-host-rescan.sh  rsync-drive-sdg.sh  set-osd-mclock-max-cap-iops.sh
```
