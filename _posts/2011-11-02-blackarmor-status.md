So my list of things to figure out keeps growing but I don't seem to get any time to work on them.

1. UPS software setup
2. DLNA server functionality
3. USB Hub issue to figure out so I can run the UPS and Printer together.
4. Serial Port hack (new)

I also want to get the serial port hack working which requires some physical work disassembling the NAS and maybe some soldering work to build a serial converter. The major work is already done by another guy on [http://crapnas.blogspot.com](http://crapnas.blogspot.com) but I'd have to follow along. There also appears to be a shortcut with an old Nokia USB cell phone cable that might be worth checking out.

Maybe next weekend I'll get some time. Project is just not getting cycles but I'm still thinking about it.
