Katie is going to China. She setup a blog on livejournal [Kate Escape](http://www.livejournal.com/~kate_escape/) to talk about her travels here and in China.

Sam just got back from Spain Monday. He is taking entrance exams at NC State and Wake Tech CC. He did really well on them.

I'll be moving the mcgarware and darkmagic webserver, domain and email over this weekend to the new Sun Ultra server and network. Oh, boy. It should be fun.

The family Sam stayed with are here in the US in New York and heading down to see us this week. You'll see some of that in Katies log. We will be travelling this month with them here and there. I'll post more later on it.
