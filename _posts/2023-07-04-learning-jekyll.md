Find where the lesson I took in Github on Jekyll? So I can reference it here.

Some of the subtle changes I made to add my stuff to the repository.

Initial Github Pages on <username>.github.io

Adding CNAME

Adding favicon.ico

Changing About page

Awesome Fonts Icons ... finding and using

Embedding Youtube video with resizing

Making images clickable for larger versions

Making links open new pages...

Resume separate repository
