title:  "A new to me but old laptop"
layout: post
categories: personal

I've been using an older Lenovo Thinkpad T460p laptop that I bought brand new May 2017 for $2210 USD with a pretty impressive discount for the time. The Thinkpad T460p released April 2016 over a year earlier from when I bought it. I over bought on the CPU/processor and bought extra power adapters and batteries upfront. It has been a great laptop but starting to show its age and I've been looking for a new laptop with a little more pep. Older USB is starting to be limiting and I'd like to go beyond 32Gb RAM.

As I looked around, nothing under $4000-$5000 USD seemed to fit the bill once I added all the features and limitations. MacBook Pro and several WinTel laptops were in the running but nothing seemed like a good fit. And all the newer laptops seem to have soldered memory or limitations on future upgrades built into them. Add to that my interest in LLM and AI/ML which has me thinking about buying a used server or high-end workstation with multiple GPUs that will cost in the multiple $1000's USD, I figure I should economize on my development laptop.

So that puts me browsing in the used market space on eBay and Craigslist.

A brief perusal brought the Lenovo Thinkpad T480 to my attention. The T480 as a January 2018 release is still an upgrade of my existing T460p that released in early 2016. I have a good bit of experience disassembling the base T-series platform as a bonus. The T480 are coming off support for large corporations and US Federal contracts. That brings the price way down in the used market.

Some key features are the T480 have an Intel i5 or i7 options in a Gen 8 CPU with and without a Nvidia GPU. It is the last generation of the T-series with removable batteries and has dual SODIMMs not soldered to the motherboard if you stay away from the slimline Ts-series.

List of stuff to do to my T480

- [x] Buy base laptop for less than $575 with an i7 and GPU
- [ ] Add 64Gb RAM
- [ ] Convert 2.5" SSD bay to NVME 2280 caddy
- [ ] Add Wifi 6e upgrade
- [ ] Check batteries (internal and external)
- [ ] Verify dual 4K monitor

List of stuff I could do to my T480

- [ ] Replace External battery with extended duration 72Wh
- [ ] Replace Internal battery
- [ ] Add a M.2 2242 SSD hard disk module
- [ ] Glass Trackpad replacement (from X1)
- [ ] LCD Rear cover magnesium (lighter case)
- [ ] Replace LCD screen with lower power version
- [ ] Replace LCD with 4k version
- [ ] Add a backlit keyboard
- [ ] Add Coral TPU M.2 Edge Accelerator B+M Key in WWAN

Advantages:

- USB C for power and 4k display external (thunderbolt 3 PCIe 2x 20Gbps)
- Two generations of upgraded processor and chipset (from Gen 6 to Gen 8)
  - 6th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-6700HQ processor
  - 8th Gen Intel® Core™ i7-8650U processor
- Non-soldered RAM on motherboard
- 64Gb capable RAM (2x32Gb from Kirby)
- NVME caddy option (but at 2x not 4x speeds)
- Replacable batteries both internal and external
- Decent priced battery replacements as T470 and T480 share them
- Decent video resolution available externally (2 x 4K monitors) - to be confirmed
- Finger print reader (biometrics)
- Upgradable Wifi to Wifi6e using Intel AX210 chipset
- WWAN port open to SSD for relatively cheap per Tb storage
- Coral TPU M.2 Edge Accelerator B+M Key in WWAN
- External eGPU with Thunderbolt 3 at 2x (pcie 2 channel not 4x)
  - [eGPU.io](https://egpu.io/best-egpu-buyers-guide/)
- eGPU via USB-C/Thunderbolt is possible
- Can add a lighted keyboard if I want too...

Disadvantage:

- Not PCIe 4x NVME only 2x channels
- Not Thunderbolt 3 with PCIe 4x (40Gbps) but only 2x (20Gbps)
- Gen 8 CPU limits RAM to 32GB modules (2x for 64Gb since we have two slots)
- CPU is only Gen 8 (i7) vs Gen 13 (i9) so showing some age
- GPU Limited Nvida MX-150 vram 2Gb is limiting
- Unlit keyboard... which I do not mind so far

Additional Options:

- Internal Battery replacement
- External Battery 72Wh extended runtime
- M.2 2242 SSD hard disk module (key type needed)
- Magnesium LCD Rear panel
