Researching plugins and extensions for WordPress has been an experience.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

One of the websites I follow, had some suggestions on plugins worth installing. Those included:

- [Ajax Edit Comments](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-ajax-edit-comments/) - keeps comment saner
- [Akismet](http://akismet.com/) - spam protection
- [Bad Behavior](http://bad-behavior.ioerror.us/) - spam protection

I’ve looking at the “[Google Publisher Plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-publisher)” as an option to integrate my Google accounts into this website. I’m still learning about how this works.

Another area I wanted to explore was form building. So far two plugins look like they are worth evaluating. They are:

- [Visual Form Builder](http://wordpress.org/plugins/visual-form-builder/)
- [CP Easy Form Builder](http://wordpress.org/plugins/cp-easy-form-builder/)

So far I’m learning a lot about this particular ecology of software. I think commenting is enabled. Leave me a comment if you have any suggestions.
