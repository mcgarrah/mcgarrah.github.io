Doing a presentation on [NIST 800-53](https://www.nist.gov/privacy-framework/nist-sp-800-53), [IRS Publication 1075](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p1075.pdf), [ISO/IEC 17799](https://www.iso.org/standard/39612.html), and how it relates to the NIST CWE (common weakness enumeration) at the IRS.

The basis is a comparison of the FTC Safeguards versus IRS Safeguards requirements.

Dear god am I boring when this excites me as much as it does.
