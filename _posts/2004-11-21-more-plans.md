## GameDev

Well the full time game development job went exactly the way I expected. I'm just not a risk taker. I'll keep doing what I'm doing now and do some development in the background. The Python code base is still there but will require a huge investment in time to complete that a full time job would have allowed. It is definitely the elegant long term solution but will never ship with my available time. The VB.Net work is starting up now and I'm evaluating it. Looks like a faster to market method but cuts out cross-platform entirely. Sad but shipping to 90% of the market is better than not shipping. My Mac G3 will just have to wait until I get more time. I'll revisit Python someday.

## Resume

Something exciting in the job area. Someone asked me for a resume. I've updated my resume and posted HTML and MSWord copies at [http://www.mcgarware.com/resume/](http://www.mcgarware.com/resume/) for public consumption. I'll get the OpenOffice and PDF versions up sometime soon. I just love creative writing.

## MKPTracker

A resurrection from the ashes. Someone is interested in an updated version of the tracking software for the Tablet PC. They need to break out the writing.stylus from the keyboard/mouse movements. I'm going to do some reading in the TabletOS SDK to see what's available. All that work I did on the centralized data repository web server may get to actually get used. The initial versions data format was horrific to parse and use. Lesson learned, make data easy to get at whatever the cost in space and performance. The central server will centralize the management of the data which gives me more control but also requires more commitment from me. Going to be an interested project no matter what happens.
