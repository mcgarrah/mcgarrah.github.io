I’ve been busy with remodeling and renovations at home and the beach house. Also getting ready for going to graduate school at the Georgia Institute of Technology [OMSCS program](http://www.omscs.gatech.edu/) and that has kind of kept me busy.

The ESXi work and other technical fun stuff has been put on hold for awhile until I can get my free time free again. That always seems to be the case.

I’ve got a couple of articles in the hopper that I have not had time to polish for release on integrating Active Directory & Kerberos on Ubuntu LTS 14.04 with Windows 2003/2008 servers and remote desktop access using a tool called [Guacamole](http://guac-dev.org/).
