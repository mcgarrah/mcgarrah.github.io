Some addition research into WP plugins have a couple more worth reviewing.

<!-- excerpt-end -->

The [Redirection plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/redirection/) will let me redirection the old darkmagic.org and mcgarware.com content to the new blog.mcgarrah.org website content being offered in WordPress. Since I’m importing a bunch of old stuff this would be handy to have setup. A tool for checking the 404 errors on the darkmagic and mcgarware would be helpful as well.

Database cleanup using the [WP-Optimize plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-optimize/) to keep the site database clean and performing well. Backups of the database seems important and [WP-DB-Backup](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-db-backup/) looks like a solution worth investigating.

A [Print Friendly](http://wordpress.org/plugins/printfriendly/) options exists and is likely to be useful for some readers of the technical content section. [Relevanssi plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/relevanssi/) replaces the built-in site search which is supposed to be lame in WP.

I might want a better editor for the content production especially for table creation and other more advanced features missing in the default editor. [TinyMCE](http://wordpress.org/plugins/tinymce-advanced/) seems like the ticket but more research needed.

If I even wanted a membership or paid section then the [Members plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/members/) looks good. Not sure this is important anytime soon but might as well check into it now.

Caching and Performance optimization is a really loaded field. These two seem to lead the pack of plugins:

- [WP Super Cache](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-super-cache/)
- [W3 Total Cache](http://wordpress.org/plugins/w3-total-cache/)

SEO (Search Engine Optimization) is a pain but probably something I need to review later once I have some content in place for the search engines.

- [AiO SEO Pack](http://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/)
- [WordPress SEO by Yoast](http://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)
- [Google Sitemap Generator](http://wordpress.org/plugins/google-sitemap-generator/)

The [Jetpack plugin](http://wordpress.org/plugins/jetpack/) seems like a features list of new thing that are coming. Looks like a bunch of feature requests that didn’t make it into the core product.

This is a beginners list as of July 2014. I’ll likely revisit these lists as I learn more and review them individually.
