I’m transferring all my technical writing and projects to this website. Over the years, I’ve accumulated a lot of technical content and wanted to centralize it.

If you are looking for the old DarkMagic repositories, those will start getting imported as I pull them from tape.
If you are looking for work on embedded ARM systems, those will get moved over as I can get time. My work on native 
VMware ESXi software development will show up as I get it in shape for others to use it. The work on open source 
software will get documented here to include at least [Eucalyptus](https://www.eucalyptus.com/), [MXE](http://mxe.cc/) and [SmarterApp](http://www.smarterapp.org/).

Lastly, I’ll probably document my work in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning here as I take course work and learn more.
