Hello, my name is Michael McGarrah and I am a technologist at heart. This is my hobby and personal website combination.

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmcgarrah/) page cover my professional career. For insanely detailed version of my resume, you can go [here](/resume/print). I have been fortunate by having very diverse professional experiences. I attended both [NC State University](https://www.ncsu.edu/) for my [Bachelors of Science in Computer Science](https://www.csc.ncsu.edu/) and later the [Georgia Institution of Technology](https://www.gatech.edu/) for my [Masters of Science in Computer Science](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/) with a focus in [Interactive Intelligence](https://omscs.gatech.edu/specialization-interactive-intelligence) the new name for Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning. My research areas included perception systems, natural language processing, and computer vision using Machine Learning.

I am primarily working in Cloud Architecture for enterprise infrastructure with a mixture of Machine Learning or other domain expertise I have picked up over the years. I'm a jack of all trades and master of some. Part of what makes jobs interesting to me is gathering up domain expertise in lots of areas.

On the personal side, I am married with two great kids. We recently have the addition of a grandson who keeps us on the move. [My wife](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lynnmcgarrah/) is also in computing as a programmer and database analyst. She is wonderful and keeps me both sane and grounded. My son is a Computer Science major and daughter is an Industrial Engineer in the aerospace industry. We are a technical family. Computers vastly outnumber people in our households.

I have two brothers, one of whom was a computer professional and worked for a major logistics distribution company. My other brother is in the medical profession for the military. My father is a retired Lt. Colonel in the United States Army and mom is a home maker.
