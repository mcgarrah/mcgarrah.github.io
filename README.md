Hello, my name is Michael McGarrah and Iâ€™m a technologist at heart. This is my hobby website.

My [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michaelmcgarrah/) page cover my professional career. I have been fortunate by having very diverse professional experiences. I attended both NC State University for my BS in CSC and Georgia Institution of Technology for my MS in CSC with a focus in natural language processing using Machine Learning.

My work primarily deals with Cloud Architecture for enterprise infrastructure with a mixture of Machine Learning or other domain expertise I have picked up over the years.

On the personal side, I am married with two children. I have a grandson who keeps me hopping. My wife is also in computing as a programmer and database administrator. She is wonderful and keeps me both sane and grounded. My son is a computer science major and daughter is an industrial engineer in the aerospace industry. We are a technical family. Computers vastly outnumber people in our households.

I have two brothers, one of whom is in a computer professional and worked for a major distribution company. My other brotheris in the medical profession for the military. My father is a retired Lt. Colonel in the United States Army and mom is a home maker.
