Wow did I learn a lesson in a combination of networking and electical power the hard way... with a blown breaker.

I got two "Powerline 500 Nano XAVB5101" plugs to try out for a quick network connection.

Powerline is a standard for pushing network traffic over power lines in a household.

TODO: Get Powerline standard ...

An arc fault circuit interrupter (AFCI) breaker protects against electrical fires by detecting dangerous electrical leaks, or arcing faults, in the branch circuit wiring. AFCIs sense when electricity is leaking and shut it off before it can overheat.

A ground fault circuit interrupter (GFCI) breaker protects against electrical shocks by shutting off electricity when it detects a ground fault. GFCIs are especially important in wet areas of the home.

AFCIs sense electricity is leaking from the electric system and shut electricity off before overheating happens. GFCIs prevent shocks by tripping. AFCIs prevent fires. GFCIs prevent shocking a person that is grounded.

AFCI breakers are sensitive to Powerline activity and will likely trip if you use it. If you have older breakers with GFCI then you are likely to have Powerline networking works just fine.
