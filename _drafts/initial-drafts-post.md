## Drafts and Published
Testings the drafts feature of Jekyll. Figuring out the difference between a ```draft``` and an un-```published``` post.

Setting an ```published: false``` entries in the ```_posts``` folder is one method to keep something from going out to the public.

Another method to hold something back is to put it in the ```_drafts``` folder.

## Post Defaults and Pagination

Interested sitewide ```defaults``` entries in the ```_config.yml``` can be found in the [front-matter-defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/front-matter-defaults/) from Jekyll docs.

[Jeykll Pagination](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/pagination/) is a major piece of an update.
