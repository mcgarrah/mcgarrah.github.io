Setting up a private SDN network on Proxmox 8.2 that can be managed by an OpenWRT with LuCI webui...

Novaspirit Tech in [Must-Have OpenWrt Router Setup For Your Proxmox](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3mPbrunpjpk) did a bang up video setting up and using an LXC version of OpenWRT on Proxmox. What it failed to do was handle HA and failover which after some work looks like you need SDN setup for an intra-cluster network.

I'm trying this out with VMs initially then will transition to LXC.

I'm going to try the direct route to OPENWRT which the Proxmox Helper Script uses for the VM
https://downloads.openwrt.org/releases/23.05.4/targets/x86/64/

My first steps into this was using the Proxmox Helper Scripts with the VM version of the OpenWRT to get my feet wet.

I'm surprised there isn't an LXC version of above. Maybe I should give it a try.

Setting up QEMU_GA (Guest Agent) has an embarassing set of Reddit posts... make sure you fully power cycle your VM and turn on the options in Proxmox for the guest agent.
