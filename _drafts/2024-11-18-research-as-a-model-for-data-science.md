DS is not SD - you fail as much or more than you successed in DS. Good DS wins less than 1 in 5. Good SD, wins more than 4 in 5.

In Data Science (DS), you are investigating datasets that may contain useful insights for a business.

In Software Development (SD), you are building something useful to the business by gathering business requirements.

In academic research, you are doing directed investigations with the intent of finding something useful or valuable to society or area of interest.

When working in DS, you need to record your failures along with the assumptions, limitations and other factors at the time of failure. This lets you revisit failures when those asummptions or data available change. As well as keep duplicate efforts into unsuccessful areas.

Academics, publish failures and how they got to them as often as success. So fail fast and often to cover the area.

1. Data Science promotion process in five stages (with maybe three in a startup): it is always about the data dummy
