[ClusterCreator: Terraform & Ansible K8S Bootstrapping on Proxmox](https://github.com/mcgarrah/ClusterCreator) by Jairus Christensen looks like an amazing opportunity for me to get a Kuberetes Cluster running in the Homelab with my existing Proxmox Cluster.

From Jairus README.md

    ClusterCreator automates the creation and maintenance of fully functional Kubernetes (K8S) clusters of any size on Proxmox. Leveraging Terraform/OpenTofu and Ansible, it facilitates complex setups, including decoupled etcd clusters, diverse worker node configurations, and optional integration with Unifi networks and VLANs.

    Having a virtualized K8S cluster allows you to not only simulate a cloud environment but also scale and customize your cluster to your needsâ€”adding or removing nodes and disks, managing backups and snapshots of the virtual machine disks, customizing node class types, and controlling state.
