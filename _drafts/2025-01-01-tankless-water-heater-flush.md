You'll spend about $100 USD in equipment the first time you do the flush.

1. a submersible pump

2. two washing machine hoses (stainless if available)

3. five-gallon plastic bucket

Once a year I flush my water heater with 2 gallons of white vinegar, which costs about $6-7 USD at the grocery store. You will want to let this run through the water heater for a couple hours. When it runs clean, you are probably okay to stop. The first time you do this, epecially if you didn't do it for awhile, you could be in for several hours.

After doing this on a yearly schedule, it should run no more than 2 hours.

I have two tankless water heaters setup so the investment is worth it for me rather than having a plumber charge me multiple hundreds of dollars every year.

I'd invest in some YouTube time to watch some videos for your specific model of tankless water heater so you konw the specifics of your setup. That is how I learned for my first venture.

Buy stainless steel hoses, good quality upfront, so that they last. Slightly over buy on the pump quality as well as you will be using this for years to come.

A key lesson learned is to thoroughly flush the pump and hoses with clean fresh water when you are finished. Let them run for awhile say 5 minutes. Leaving vinegar residue will destroy any rubber components in the pump and hoses while in storage.
